### Hey, I'm Liam!
### I'm a college student studying cybersecurity. I'm currently an active competitor in the NCL (National Cyber League) which is a defensive and offensive puzzle-based, capture-the-flag style cybersecurity competition. I'm also involved in various cybersecurity groups such as Cloud Security Alliance-Detroit, Greater Detroit ISC2 Chapter, and the University of Michigan group- Michigan Hackers.
