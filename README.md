 # Welcome!
 
  I‚Äôm Liam!

I am a Cybersecurity and Computer Science Student at [Eastern Michigan University](https://www.emich.edu/).

I have a strong passion for all things cybersecurity! üîê My interests include building security tools using threats and vulnerability data, automating complex workflows, and researching vulnerabilities.  

I use GitHub as a digital portfolio to showcase my personal projects and coursework.

Check out [My Projects](https://github.com/liamchambers9?tab=repositories) and [How I'm learning Python](https://github.com/liamchambers9/LearningPythonForSecurity) to view more about my work in security and development.
